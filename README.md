# Allocated-Project_Fake-News-Detection
Fake news can have severe consequences, such as influencing public opinion, polarizing societies, and eroding trust in media. Detection systems use techniques like natural language processing and machine learning to automatically identify and filter out misinformation. The objective is to enhance information quality, empower users to make informed decisions, and protect online communities from the negative impacts of fake news. Ongoing research aims to stay ahead of evolving tactics in order to create a more trustworthy information ecosystem.

The dataset employed for this project originates from Kaggle and is available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emineyetm/fake-news-detection-datasets. It comprises the following details pertinent to fake news detection:
Customer-centric information, such as account age, credit limit, and spending behavior.
It's crucial to emphasize that the attributes in this dataset tailored for fake news detection differ from those present in the Telco Customer Churn dataset. This distinction underscores the specialized focus on identifying and combatting misinformation in the context of fake news.

## Methodology
The dataset is strategically split into training and testing sets to comprehensively evaluate the model's performance.

## Data Cleaning
Comprehensive data cleaning procedures are implemented to handle missing values and address outliers or anomalies in the dataset. The goal is to create a clean and reliable dataset for subsequent analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
In-depth exploratory data analysis techniques are applied to gain valuable insights into the distribution of fake and non-fake news. Visualization tools are utilized to uncover patterns, correlations, and anomalies in key features, contributing to a deeper understanding of the data.

## Feature Engineering
To enhance model performance, feature engineering strategies are implemented. This may involve creating new features, transforming existing ones, or extracting meaningful information to enrich the dataset.

## Feature Scaling
Certain machine learning models require feature scaling for optimal performance. Techniques such as scaling and normalization are applied to ensure consistency and effectiveness in the modeling process.

## Data Imbalance
To mitigate potential class imbalance, appropriate techniques are employed. For example, oversampling methods like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) are used to synthetically increase the representation of the minority class ('fake news').

## Preprocessing Function
A dedicated Python function, fake_news_prep(dataframe), is crafted to consolidate and execute all preceding preprocessing steps on the test data. This function adeptly handles missing values by imputing them with the mean value derived from the training set.

## Models Training
State-of-the-art machine learning models are employed for classification tasks. Rigorous training and evaluation processes are carried out to select the most effective model, considering factors such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

```python

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Assuming 'X_train' is the feature matrix and 'y_train' is the target variable

# Instantiate the Random Forest Classifier
rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Fit the model to the training data
rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test data
y_pred = rf_model.predict(X_test)
